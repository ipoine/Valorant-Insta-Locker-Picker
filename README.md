!!Quick Tips and Notes!!
- When you press "Click" button it spams locking buttons for 10 seconds, so if you press the "Click" button to early it wont lock.
- Use Valorant at Windowed tab otherwise insta-locker may not work (didnt tried)
- U can take game to Windowed tab by pressing F11
- After pressing F11 i suggest you to not move the game tab insta-locker may miss click
